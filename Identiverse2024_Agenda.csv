Indeed, so much ó digital identity management‚Äù boils down to key management. In almost every modern application we need to bind public keys to humans and non-human entities, and we need assurance that private keys and secret symmetric keys are under the proper control of those entities. We also need evidence of the quality of all those keys and the cryptographic software that uses them. The emerging field of Confidential Computing (CC) helps address these critical issues at the infrastructure layer. CC makes hardware-backed cryptographic security available to all applications and workloads, thanks to ó Trusted Execution Environments‚Äù, or TEEs ‚Äì literally, digital identity engines. Remote attestation services provide assurance of hardware and software integrity in every TEE. This panel of CC leaders will traverse the practical issues of CC and digital identity management, and show how CC is going to become essential for authentication and data protection for all digital entities, applications, and workloads.

This talk will consider what a new SaaS cyber kill chain looks like for modern organizations that are SaaS native without an internal network and the surprising number of attacks that are possible without touching company-owned infrastructure. We'll consider topics like how the initial access stage is changing due to the availability of new beachheads, what lateral movement looks like in a world with no internal infrastructure, and how persistence methods have changed and are resilient to common containment measures such as password resets and secure device wipes.

For good reasons, public concerns about these systems are growing. However, the biometrics industry overall and the entities rolling out those implementations to the public have done a poor job communicating about how their systems work. These communication failures put the identity industry at risk because in the eyes of the public, biometrics are a part of their identities, while in reality these are two rather separate fields where players haven‚Äôt collaborated much in a meaningful way across fields. At the heart of this session is a taxonomy of biometric use-cases along with names and icons to describe them. These range from on-device biometric matching for authentication to unlock a phone to real time video where faces are being recognized and then compared to a database of millions of faces to identify who is walking down a public street in real time.

What tends to come out of recertification is the unfortunate entitlement or access creep that enables that extra access stemming from the habit of clicking yes to all seemingly relevant access selected. While these decisions are stuck in the moment they are decided and do not update until the next cycle, runtime authorization policy checks happen in the exact second access is requested.

Decisions on privilege should be based on real-time policies and consistent data governance that speak more to our continuously evolving business landscape.

SMS fraud is a worldwide plague perpetuated by sophisticated and highly organized criminal groups. Their goal is to generate as much revenue as possible by sending SMS messages through foreign carriers that pay the fraudsters a commission, without getting caught. Fraudsters use bots and fraud farms to create fake accounts at sites where they find vectors to pump SMS messages to lists of mobile phone numbers they have obtained. With SMS OTP increasing in popularity as an authentication factor, it has also become a prime target of SMS fraud in countries with carriers that pay fraudsters SMS commissions.

This is a trick question, of course, because from cloud providers to end users, every person on the supply chain has some responsibility. But, the question invites a debate that feels timeless: how to balance security with experience and choice. How do you get to the decision that wearing a seatbelt is such an important safety measure that it can no longer be left to individual discretion, but should instead be law in many countries? The wisdom of this minor tradeoff is generally uncontroversial now, but that wasn't always the case. Identity faces conceptually similar conflicts. Cyberattacks increased substantially across industries since 2020, impacting public and private institutions as well as individuals. Many of these were credential attacks with a simple but effective mitigation: multi-factor authentication. But there‚Äôs a catch: user enrollment is generally low, and organizations are reluctant to introduce additional steps (or cost) in their users‚Äô login experiences. I propose that we‚Äôre at an inflection point: changes in threat actor activities, as well as advances in user-centric security tools mean it‚Äôs time to assess new decision-making paradigms. Join my session to learn more about AWS‚Äô journey to enforcing MFA with a high bar for customer experience.

This poses a challenge for smaller organizations unable to afford such expenses and obstructs the realization of benefits even with training. Large organizations struggle with lengthy onboarding processes and complex implementations, leaving business lines frustrated with their inability to execute tasks efficiently. By harnessing Generative AI, the requirement to decipher vendor terminology and navigate complex UIs is eliminated, resulting in a standardized interface, enhanced productivity, and substantial deployment and maintenance savings. This engagement model empowers all stakeholders, from deployment personnel to help desk teams, to effectively interact with IGA.

This approach extends beyond traditional methods like data minimization, masking, and encryption, proposing a more comprehensive strategy for ensuring digital privacy and security. In a world of increasingly sophisticated digital threats, the Zero Trust model has become a cornerstone of cyber security. However, incorporating Zero Identity into this model marks a significant evolution. Our panel, comprising leading experts in identity management and privacy, will explore how Zero Identity enhances Zero Trust by embedding privacy and ethical considerations into the fabric of identity management. Key topics include innovations in distributed data governance, the role of digital wallets and verifiable credentials, and the ethical implications of data collection and usage. The panel will provide insights into how organizations can adopt these principles to comply with global data protection and privacy regulations, build customer trust, and drive market expansion.

Relying Parties register with Identity Providers and exchange trust information so that the RP can know that they are talking to Microsoft, Google, Facebook etc. We have also had Smart Cards (PIV/CAC) for authentication based on a certificate signed by someone that chains back to a known trusted root. The smart card approach avoids the RP needing to register but has significant user privacy issues. The research and education communities have long understood the scalability issues with these approaches. This led to the development of SAML2 and SAML metadata being used to represent more complicated trust relationships, where a single RP may allow identities from hundreds of Identity providers without needing to set up bilateral relationships. We are now entering a new world of Identity Wallets that look a lot more like multilateral federations than a simple one-to-one relationship. For these sorts of credentials to be scalable, we need to represent how a RP/Verifier can be part of perhaps hundreds of overlapping trust groupings. While it might be practical in just the EU to issue special TLS certificates to RP so that they can ask for credentials, that quickly breaks down if multiple countries outside the EU decide that is a good model.

It is tempting to think of externalising authorization as a technology problem.

Identity proofing technologies are advancing apace, and provide increasingly convenient and reliable mechanisms for organisations to meet their regulatory obligations. Proof of age, right to work, professional certification... there are plenty of very valid reasons to verify certain elements of our identity. But there are some downsides. Unnecessary verification or overly intrusive processes impede the user journey; often causing a customer to abandon, or to seek an alternative provider. Over-verification is also a leading cause of excessive personal data retention. In the end, over-adoption of verification and proofing could put even necessary deployments at risk of circumvention or under-engagement. Join Steve Wilson and Andi Hindle on an unapologetic journey through the best and the worst examples of identity proofing. Double check the problem we're trying to solve in identification, and discover when ‚Äî and how ‚Äî to consider pushing back on the adoption of this technology.

This includes the development of a European Digital Identity (EUDI) wallet. This wallet can be implemented as a web wallet running in a browser. This means a smartphone is not required to use the wallet ‚Äì making it inclusive and independent of app stores and phone vendors. Instead of using native APIs to protect cryptographic keys, this web wallet can use FIDO security keys to secure the wallet. FIDO is a natural fit to secure digital wallets as users are becoming more and more familiar with its associated registration and sign in flows now many websites have adopted passkeys as a means to access their services. In this session, we will discuss how the wallet works, how FIDO is used to protect the wallet, highlight current use cases of how the wallet is being used by EU member states, and how this model can be replicated in other countries around the world.",Joshua 1,10:15 AM,10:40 AM,0:25:00,"Friday, May 31",Session,,1,1080547,Joost,Van Dijk,https://identiverse.com/idv24/speaker/1080547/,Developer Advocate,Yubico,https://assets.swoogo.com/uploads/full/3511351-65c12a93a4959.jpeg,https://linked.in/joostd,https://twitter.com/joostd,"Joost van Dijk is a developer advocate at Yubico, the inventor of the YubiKey.
